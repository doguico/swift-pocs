Calculator

ToDo:

- Undo functionality (backspace functionality already implemented)
- Add app icons to your Assets.xcassets file . The only trick here is to provide versions of your icon in all the right sizes.
- Create a launch screen for your Calculator in LaunchScreen.storyboard. Remember that you will want to use some simple autolayout to make your launch screen look good on all platforms.
- Improve UI
